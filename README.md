# BCM Training and Consultancy
## Overview
### What is this website for?
This website is for a company that offers training and consultancy services for care agencies that provide Domiciliary Care. 
### What does it do?
Allows care agencies to learn more about BCM, sign up to book onto open group / private courses and to arrange consultancy meetings. The account functionality allows care agencies to review and amend booking through their user portal. They can also message BCM directly and leave testimonials.
### How does it work?
The site is built using the powerful Django framework to manage all of the back-end, create the models and SQL database and route the site to the different pages and views. Bootstrap and JS are used to create a responsive, modern front-end experience.

## Tech Used
### The Tech Used Includes:
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
    - I use **Bootstrap** to give my project a simple, tidy and mobile friendly responsive layout.
- [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com)
    - I use **Django** as the backbone of the whole website. It manages the back-end, helps share content and database entries with the front-end and controls which views are shown depending on the current URL.
- [SQLite](https://sqlite.org)
    - I use **SQLite** which comes bundled with **Django** to store all of my data in a SQL database.
- [Stripe](https://stripe.com/gb)
    - **Stripe** is used to safely and securely handle payments from customers.
## Content Used
### Sources
- [Django Documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.11/)
    - I have used the **Django** documentation files to look up support when stuck with a certain aspect of the framework.
- [stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
    - **stack overflow** is always invaluable at providing support when struggling to implement a new feature or fix a bug.
